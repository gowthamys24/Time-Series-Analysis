# Time-Series-Analysis
This project demonstrates how to perform time series forecasting using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model in Python.
It covers data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and visualization, creating a complete end-to-end workflow for predicting future values of a given dataset.

The dataset used is a univariate time series containing date-indexed observations.
The goal is to build a model that can forecast future values accurately while minimizing forecast error.
